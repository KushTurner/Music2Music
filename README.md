Converts a playlist from Spotify to Apple Music

Quota 10,000 per day

Create playlist = 50    
Search = 1
Add to playlist = 50

Therefore:

Adding 1 song = 50 + 1

10,000 / 51 = 196.078431372549

195 * 51 = 9945

Also need to create the playlist 

9945 + 50 = 9995

Therefore: 

I can create a playlist with 195 songs in a day (maximum)
